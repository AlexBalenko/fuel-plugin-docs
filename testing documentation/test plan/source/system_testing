System testing
==============

* This section provides information on the test cases that are obligatory for your plugin.

  * These cases serve to make sure that your plugin does not break the Mirantis OpenStack environments.

* Please note that Mirantis recommends that you used the HA environment configuration for testing purposes:

  * At least three controllers must be configured to have a reliable HA environment;
    this is the minimum requirement for quorum-based clusters, such as Pacemaker and Galera.
    The controller cluster can include more than three servers to increase the level of reliability.
    For more information about how Fuel deploys HA, see
    `Multi-node with HA Deployment <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/reference-architecture.html#multi-node-ha>`_.
    
.. note:: System testing includes OSTF as the tool recommended by Mirantis.
