Test strategy
=============

*Provide information on types of implemented tests (that enter test cases below). Specify which tests will be automated.*

Types of tests included
-----------------------

*Provide information on specific type of tests included into the current scope.*

Types of tests not included
---------------------------

*Provide information on specific types of tests excluded from the scope.*

Acceptance criteria
-------------------

*Provide information on the set of basic tests that should be performed to consider that the feature has passed the testing process.*

Test environment and infrastructure
-----------------------------------

*If all cases have one environment, put all information about hardware, software and other issues necessary for the plugin into this section and remove ‘Environment’ row from every test case . If not, then skip this section and fill in ‘Environment’ section in every case table.*

.. note:: If you plugin is hardware-specific, provide instructions on accessing your lab.
